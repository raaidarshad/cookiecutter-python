# Raaid's Cookiecutter Template

This is my first (and primary) [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) template for Python projects. It is opinionated. It uses:
- Poetry: Dependency management, (Project publishing to come? Might be too different project to project)
- pre-commit: Code style checks before git commits
- Black: Code style
- isort: Import order
- flake8: Pep8 adherence
- mypy: Static type checking
- Docker: Containerize business logic
- pytest: Testing
- GitHub: Version control and CI workflows (CD to come? Might be too different project to project)
